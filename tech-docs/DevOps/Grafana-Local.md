# Grafana Local Runtime â€” Git Hygiene

We adjusted .gitignore to ignore local Grafana runtime files (not source code) to keep the repo clean.

## Files affected
- .gitignore
- grafana-config.ini, grafana-data/, grafana-provisioning/, grafana.db
- Also added ignores for image formats (*.png, *.svg) within logs/public exports context

## Why
- Prevents committing large/binary runtime data generated by local Grafana setup.

## Operator note
- The grafana-* files under project root are for local development convenience only. Do not rely on them as the source of truth; provision dashboards via code or documented export/import when promoting to higher environments.
